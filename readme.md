## First Person Interactive Special Relativity Simulator

The goal of this project is to provide an interactive SR simulator that can run on almost any computer and provide an accurate depiction of life in the fastlane.

Imagine what the world would look like if the speed of light was instantly changed to twice your walking speed.
